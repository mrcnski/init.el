** About

Hey there! You're looking at my Emacs configuration, a labor of love and daring.
It's pretty much all here, right in the =init.el= file. It's my personal
configuration and I'm the only user, so be it what it may, it will surely break
on your machine. Among other things, it does things like open files on startup,
files that you won't have (nor would want to have). Be it what it may, you can
have a look around and take inspiration for your own config. If your wandering
eye doth spot anything amiss, bounce me an Issue on the repository and I'll have
a look-see. Who knows? I might even Paypal you a buckaroo for your troubles.
